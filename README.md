A lot of the formulas for calculating player stats were derived from several Wikis primarily http://darksouls.wikidot.com/
Additional formulas and calculations have been derived from and reverse engineered from a wonderfully useful spreadsheet found at https://sites.google.com/site/darksoulstats/home All credit for their acquisition can be attributed to their associated developers (Thank you!)

Authors and contrubuters of spreadsheet include:

Additional thank yous to members of the Dark Souls modding Discord who helped point me in the right direction to ensure that stats displayed are accurate and formulas follow those found in game (currently only Dark Souls, Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition and Dark Souls Remastered)

Final thank you to Nate at MugenMoneky.com - another far more complete Character Planner for games across the Souls series for creating their planner and inspiring me to want to take up the challenge and create my own.
